By narrowing our criteria and incorporating both average outage duration and total number of events, we define risk levels more accurately:\n",

    "- High Risk â€“ Average outage duration > 24 hours OR total events > 20\n",
    "- Medium Risk â€“ Average outage duration between 12â€“24 hours OR total events between 10â€“20\n",
