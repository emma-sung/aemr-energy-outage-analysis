# 🏙️ AEMR Electrical Outage Case Study

## 🔍 About

In this case study, I analyzed energy market data for the **American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR)** using **SQL** and **Tableau**. The goal was to derive insights that could inform regulatory decisions and optimize market operations.

By performing data transformations and aggregations with SQL, I prepared the data for visualization. I then used Tableau to create dynamic dashboards, highlighting key trends and patterns in energy outages.

Key metrics analyzed:
- Frequency of outages
- Energy loss
- Main contributors to outages

These visualizations enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, helping identify pain points and ensuring greater transparency and efficiency in energy market operations.
