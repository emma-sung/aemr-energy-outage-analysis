## 🧾 Dataset Overview

- Source: Springboard
- Includes records of outages with:
  - Date and time
  - Region
  - Energy lost
  - Cause of outage
  - Utility company

---

## ❓ Key Questions

- Which regions experience the most outages?
- What are the main causes of energy loss?
- Which utility providers are responsible for the highest energy loss?
- Are there seasonal trends in outages?

---

## 🔍 Analysis Approach

1. **SQL Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned and transformed raw outage records
   - Grouped and aggregated by region, cause, and time period

2. **Visualization in Tableau**
   - Dynamic dashboards to explore energy loss and outage distribution
   - Story dashboard to communicate findings visually

---

## 🧾 Summary & Recommendations

- **Most Frequent Outage Type:** Forced outages were the most common across both years.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Jun-Aug and Oct-Nov experienced spikes in forced outages.
- **Reliability Issues:** GW, AURICON, and MELK experienced significantly more outages than others.

---

## 📌 Recommendations:
- Investigate operational practices of providers with high outage rates.
- Explore preventative maintenance strategies to reduce forced outages.
- Prioritize investments in grid stability for high-outage regions.
